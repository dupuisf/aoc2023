# Advent of Code 2023 in Lean 4

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Lean 4.

## Installation instructions

Make sure you have a working Lean 4 installation (see [here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) for how to do that), and then type `lake build` in the main directory. The
executable should appear in ``build/bin``.
